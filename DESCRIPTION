Description: The piece-wise exponential (additive mixed) model
    (PAMM; Bender and Scheipl (2018) <doi: 10.1177/1471082X17748083>) is a
    powerful model class for survival analysis, based on generalized additive
    (mixed) models (GA(M)Ms). It offers intuitive specification and robust
    estimation of complex survival models with stratified baseline hazards,
    random effects, time-varying effects, time-dependent covariates and
    cumulative effects (Bender et. al. (2018) <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxy003>.
    pammtools provides functions and utilities that facilitate fitting Piece-wise
    Exponential Additive Mixed Models (PAMMs), including data transformation and
    other convenience functions for pre and post-processing as well as
    visualization.
