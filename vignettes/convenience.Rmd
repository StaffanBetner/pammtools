# Convenience functions

Survival analysis entails a set of standard tasks
beyond model estimation which need to be performed in most real world applications.
These task include:

- summary/visualization of estimated effects
- extraction/visualization of the estimated baseline hazard
- extraction/visualization of the predicted (cumulative) hazards or survival probabilities
for specific covariate specifications
- comparison of the predicted (cumulative) hazards or survival probabilities for a set
of covariate specifications
- comparison of the predicted (cumulative) hazards or survival probabilities and estimated effects
resulting from different model specifications or different subsets of the data.

This package contains some convenience functions to achieve these tasks.
The overall philosophy of the package was to provide functions that return the
underlying data used for visualization in a *tidy* format [@wickham2014], such that everybody
can use familiar tools for further processing. In addition, some convenience functions
for visualization are also included.

We use the `mgus2` data [@kyle1993] from the `survival` package for illustration
in the following.


## Summary/visualization of fixed effects

```{r model, cache =TRUE}
data("mgus2", package = "survival")
ped <- mgus2 %>% as_ped(Surv(futime, death)~age + hgb + sex, id = "id")
pam <- gam(ped_status ~ s(tend) + sex + age + s(hgb), data = ped,
  family = poisson(), offset = offset)
```

The easiest way to obtain an overview of the estimated coefficients for fixed effects
is to simply call `summary` on the fitted model object:

```{r, dependson="model"}
summary(pam)
```

However, we also provide a convenience function that extracts a fixed coefficient
table from `mgcv::gam` objects (including confidence intervals) and
a convenience function that creates a forrest-type plot:

```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height=3}
tidy_fixed(pam) # per default intercept is ommitted
gg_fixed(pam)
```

We can see that the estimated mortality risk for male subjects is increased by a factor of about $\exp(`r round(coef(pam)[2], 2)`) = `r round(exp(coef(pam)[2]), 2)`$
compared to female subjects.

<!--
Additionally, this package provides a function to visualize fixed coefficients
in terms of tree/forest plots:

```{r}
## yet to be implemented
```
-->

## Summary/visualization of smooth effects
A first quick overview over the smooth effects is provided in the bottom part of
output of the `summary` call above. The interpretation is the same as as for
`mgcv::gam` objects (see `?summary.gam` for details). Briefly, the `edf` column
provides the number of effective degrees of freedom used to fit the spline
(values larger than 1 indicate non-linearity) and the p-value refers to
a significance test against the null hypothesis of "no effect"
(i.e., $H_0: f_j(x_j) = 0$; test developed in @wood2013).

Usually, however, we want to visualize the non-linear effect by plotting
$f_j(x_j)$ over the range of $x_j$ values. One possibility using base R
plotting functions is to call the default plot function for `mgcv::gam` objects.
Note that PAM effects are additive on the log-hazard scale, so we have to plot
$\exp(f_j(x_j))$ (right panel below) in order to read hazard *ratios* off the figure:

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=4, warning=FALSE}
## extract smooths plot data
shgb <- tidy_smooth(pam) %>% filter(xlab=="hgb")
## create plots for hgb effect
hgb_ggp <- ggplot(shgb, aes(x=x)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=fit)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=low, ymax=high), alpha=0.1) +
  ylab("f(hgb)") + xlab("hgb")
hgb_ggp_log <- ggplot(shgb, aes(x=x)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=exp(fit))) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=exp(low), ymax=exp(high)), alpha=0.1) +
  ylab("exp(f(hgb))") + xlab("hgb")+
  coord_trans(y="log")
## combine into one graph
grid.draw(
    cbind(
        ggplotGrob(hgb_ggp),
        ggplotGrob(hgb_ggp_log),
        size = "last"))
```

If you want to customize the figure using other graphics packages you can
extract the data used for plotting via:

```{r}
hgb.term <- ped %>% get_terms(fit = pam, terms = "hgb")
head(hgb.term)
```

For convenience we also include a function that plots multiple selected smooth
effects in one figure^[Note that graphical representation of the baseline hazard
is a slight approximation here -- it should be a *step function*, since the
baseline is piecewise constant over the intervals, cf. the baseline hazard function plotted correctly below.]:

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height=4}
ped %>% gg_smooth(pam, terms = c("tend", "hgb"))
```


## Extraction/Visualization of the baseline hazard

In PAMs the baseline hazard $\lambda_0(t)$ is estimated semi-parametrically as a
(potentially) non-linear smoothed step function. Thus the model specification
usually looks like

$$
\log(\lambda(t|x)) = \beta_0 + f_0(t) + \ldots
$$

Thus the term $f_0(t)$ represents the time-varying part of the log-baseline-hazard.

To create a data set with all interval cut-points we can use the function
`ped_info` applied to an object of class `ped` (**p**iece-wise **e**xponential **d**ata).
In addition to information about each interval, the data set returned by the function contains
mean values of continuous variables and the modal values of categorical variables.

```{r}
ped_df  <- ped_info(ped)
head(ped_df)
tail(ped_df)
```

This data set can be used to conveniently obtain the hazard, cumulative hazard and survival functions evaluated at the joint mean (and mode) of the covariates for all time points in the data:

```{r}
ped_df <- ped_df %>% add_hazard(pam)
ped_df %>% select(interval, hazard, ci_lower, ci_upper) %>% head()
ped_df %>% select(interval, hazard, ci_lower, ci_upper) %>% tail()
```

Which in turn can be conveniently plotted using respective functions, e.g.

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
ggplot(ped_df, aes(x = tend)) +
	geom_step(aes(y = hazard)) +
	geom_stepribbon(aes(ymin = ci_lower, ymax = ci_upper), alpha = 0.2) +
	ylab(expression(hat(lambda)(t))) + xlab(expression(t))
```

or the cumulative hazard

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
gg.chaz <- ped_df %>% add_cumu_hazard(pam) %>%
	ggplot(aes(x = tend, y = cumu_hazard, ymin = cumu_lower, ymax = cumu_upper))
gg.chaz + geom_line() + geom_ribbon(alpha = 0.2) +
	ylab(expression(hat(Lambda)(t))) + xlab(expression(t))
```

or the survival probabilities

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
gg.surv <- ped_df %>% add_surv_prob(pam) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = tend, y = surv_prob, ymax = surv_lower, ymin = surv_upper))
gg.surv + geom_line() + geom_ribbon(alpha = 0.2) +
  ylab(expression(hat(S)(t))) + xlab(expression(t))
```

This approach is very convenient, as the usual tidy `dplyr` workflow can
be maintained throughout, for example, if we wanted to plot the cumulative
hazard for different sexes:

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=3}
pinfo.sex <- ped %>% group_by(sex) %>% ped_info() %>% add_cumu_hazard(pam)
head(pinfo.sex)
table(pinfo.sex$sex)
ggplot(pinfo.sex, aes(x = tend, y = cumu_hazard)) +
	geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = cumu_lower, ymax = cumu_upper, fill = sex), alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_line(aes(col = sex)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  ylab(expression(hat(Lambda)(t))) + xlab(expression(t))
```
