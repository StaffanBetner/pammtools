#' Wrapping function for PEMs with competing risks using stats::glm
#' 
#' This function serves as a wrapper for the glm function (stats) to be 
#' applicable to competing risks. Competing risks are separately modelled 
#' in their own glm. The results can be interpreted synoptically, 
#' using the corresponding methods (summary etc.) or separately using the glm
#' methods for each entry alone.
#' The input is entered as for a single risk PEM.
#' 
#' @param formula an object of class formula or a string convertible to it.
#' The model formula corresponding to a glm (from the stats package).
#' @param family the family of the glm to be modelled. Only poisson is
#'  reasonable. Hence, any other input will not be accepted.
#' @param data A data.frame of class ped_cr that features time-to-event data
#' and convariates. (see https://adibender.github.io/pammtools/)
#' @param offset The offset for each observation. Contained in data.
#' @param ... additional arguments passed to the glm function.
#' @return a list of glms - one entry for a single competing risk.

#' extended formula, which specifies how TDCs should be transformed using
#' specials concurrent and cumulative.
