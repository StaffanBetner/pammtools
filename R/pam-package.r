#' pam: Piece-wise exponential Additive Models
#' 
#' pam provides functions and utilities that facilitate fitting 
#' Piece-wise Exponential (Additive) Models, including data transformation and 
#' other convenience functions for pre- and postprocessing as well as plotting.
#' 
#' The best way to get an overview of the functionality provided and how to 
#' fit PAMs is to view the vignettes included in this package. A summary 
#' of the vignettes content is given below:

#' \itemize{
#' \item \code{basics}: Introduction to PAMs and basic modeling.
#' \item \code{baseline}: Shows how to estimate and visualize baseline model 
#' (without covariates) and comparison to respective Cox-PH model.}
