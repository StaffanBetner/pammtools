\description{
These functions are designed to extract (or mimick) the cumulative coefficients
usually used in additive hazards models (Aalen model) to depict (time-varying)
covariate effects. For PAMMs, these are the differences
between the cumulative hazard rates where all covariates except one have the
identical values. For a numeric covariate of interest, we calculate
\eqn{Lambda(t|x+1) - Lambda(t|x)}.  For non-numeric covariates
the cumulative hazard of the reference level is substracted from
the cumulative hazards eveluated at all non reference levels. Standard
errors are calculated using the delta method.
