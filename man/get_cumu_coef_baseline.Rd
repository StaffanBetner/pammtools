\description{
These functions are designed to mimick the cumulative coefficients
usually used in additive hazards models (Aalen model) to depict (time-varying)
covariate effects. For PAMMs, these can be interpreted as the differences
between the cumulative hazard rates where all covariates except one have the
same values. For the a numeric covariate of interest we calculate
Lambda(t|x+1) - Lambda(t|x).  For non-numeric covariates of interest
the cumulative hazard of the reference level is substracted from
the cumulative hazards eveluated at all non reference levels. Standard
errors are calculated using the delta method.
